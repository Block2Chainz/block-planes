# Introduction
BlockPlanes is a top-down aerial shooter with unique, randomly-generated, player-owned planes that can be bought, sold, and shown off. The plane attributes are stored in an Ethereum smart contract as non-fungible collectible token. It is also a full social platform with live-chat, friends, notifications, and leaderboards. Play single player or against your friends.
