# Introduction
BlockPlanes is a top-down aerial shooter with unique, randomly-generated, player-owned planes that can be bought, sold, and shown off. The plane attributes are stored in an Ethereum smart contract as an ERC-721 token. It is also a full social platform with live-chat, friends, and notifications. Play single player, against your friends, or against a random opponent.
